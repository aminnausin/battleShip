# Svelte battleship clone

This is a simple battleship clone built with Svelte, Tailwind and Express that facilitates online multiplayer. UI is heavily inspired by Phil Goodwin's design on figma but fully custom built for Tailwind. Sounds were borrowed from some strategy games I play for fun and added effect.
